# Mathematical-analysis-of-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
A summary of Understanding Convolutionnal Neural Network (CNN) By Stephan Mallat is Given. This article gives an 
interpretation of actions performed by Deep neural networks on input data space. A simplified version of CNN without 
channels recombination is first considered. It is shown that they can be seen as scatering trees and show invariance to 
translations and small diffeomorphism. It is shown that cascade scattering acts as linearization of the orbits action of 
symmetries of function f . In order to also get rotation invariance, the channels recombination are taken into account and 
studied with hierarchical wavelet scattering.
